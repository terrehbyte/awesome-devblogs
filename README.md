# Awesome Devblogs

Here's a quick collection of links to **game developer** blogs and/or portfolios
that I've found interesting. This repository serves two purposes:

- Writing down cool people (and companies) that do cool things
- Showcasing various ways to showcase your work

To help showcase different types of portfolios, I've split the list into those
that are **strictly portfolios**, while others are **portfolios with a blog
attached**. Company websites are also included in their own section, reflecting
how larger organizations differ in voice and presentation.

Developer blogs **explore past (or present!) problems** encountered during
development and/or provide **tutorial content** on solving specific needs. They

are frequented by the games industry (or adjacent) that provide a space for you
to do so.

There are other solutions that are less reliant on a platform like Netlify or
GitHub Pages, but they will require additional setup on your part.
